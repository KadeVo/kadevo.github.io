      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>As a Junior Full-Stack Developer, I possess an impressive aresnal of skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Tailwind,  Node.js, SQLite, and REST API. I transitioned my career after uncovering my passion for problem solving during my bachelor degree. I decided to code as a hobby and fell in love with it. I decided to enroll into Dev Academy where they gave me hands on experience in a team environment.This hands-on experience allowed me to cultivate my skills, not just as an individual coder, but as a collaborative team player. I took on challenges that mirrored real-world scenarios, honing my ability to solve complex problems while working seamlessly within a team. I am enthusiastic about creating innovative solutions and contributing to meaningful projects. I am not just a developer; I am a passionate problem solver, a team collaborator, and a lifelong learner who wants to make a change.  </p>

            This is my capstone project at Dev Academ Aotearoa. We spent 5 days working on it in a modern software development team environment under agile methodologies. I acted as the Scrum Facilitator and worked on the front-end styling of the initial dashboard, each widget styling, and worked on backend to frontend on the todo, gift ideas & budget calculator widgets. I got to work with multiple people in an intense developing situation due to the time constraint. I learnt how to function better as a team, reinforced backend knowledge, how to problem-solve with others, and improved my ability of being a Scrum Facilitator. One thing I think I could have improved on is hosting more meetings for the team. I think although my group met up a couple times a day, I personally felt it would have been nice to have everyone checked up on more and discuss issues as a team because everyone is learning from this project & we could have combined our learning.

          <h3>Job Board</h3>

          <p>
            This is my personal project. I created it because early on in Dev Academy, I wanted to practice backend to frontend. I got the idea to create a job board primarily because I wanted to make a new place for people to place graduate and entry level jobs. This project used SQLite as the database, React.js & Tailwind CSS. I learnt more complex Tailwind CSS, improved knowledge on React and learnt the disicpline of working on a solo project. I thought it would be easy to make a solo project as I had full controll over everything but I realised I still need to plan every step of the way so I know exactly what I am doing when I do not have other people there to keep me accountable. Looking back now, I could improve a lot on the User Interface and style but I think it was overall, a great learning experience for me and taught me a lot.

          <p>
            Tailored Tails is our latest project, created with the goal of developing our own Authorization System and Cart. Collaborating with a friend, we faced numerous challenges throughout the process, with the most significant hurdle being the implementation of a robust Authorization system and Cart functionality. Our tech stack included React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, NodeJS, Redux, Stripe, and MongoDB.

            One of the major challenges was determining the optimal approach for managing user items in the Cart. Initially considering a database-centric solution, we eventually discovered the simplicity and efficiency of using local storage. This adjustment significantly improved manageability.
            
            Throughout the project, we engaged in extensive research, experimenting with various approaches, and adapting based on trial and error. The learning curve was steep as we delved into Redux, MongoDB, Stripe integration, and the creation of a custom Login/Registration system. Despite the hurdles, the project provided invaluable insights into the complexities of everyday systems.
            
            Looking back, the experience not only enhanced our technical skills but also expanded our problem-solving mindset. This project means a lot to me as my friend and I struggled every day for a while, overcoming multiple hurdles and giving us more experience in having to tackle problems at a different angle.
